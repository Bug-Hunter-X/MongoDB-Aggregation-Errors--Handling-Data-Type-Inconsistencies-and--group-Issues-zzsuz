```javascript
// Improved aggregation pipeline with error handling
db.users.aggregate([
  {
    $match: { age: { $gt: 25, $type: "number" } }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: {city: "$city", age: "$age" }, //Ensure unique _id, handling nulls 
      averageAge: { $avg: "$age" }
    }
  },
    { $group: { //re-group if needed
        _id: "$_id.city",
        averageAge: {$avg: "$averageAge"}
    }}
])

//Alternative solution using $cond to handle non-numeric ages
db.users.aggregate([
  {
    $match: { age: { $gt: 25 } }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$city",
      averageAge: {
        $avg: {
          $cond: [{
            $isNumber: "$age" 
          }, "$age", 0] //Replace non-numeric ages with 0
        }
      }
    }
  }
])
```
This improved pipeline adds a `$match` stage to filter out non-numeric ages using `$type` and to handle potential null city values. The `$cond` operator in the second solution helps to replace non-numeric values in the 'age' field with a default (like 0) before applying `$avg`. Note that these solutions assume that an empty city field is acceptable; if you need to exclude documents with empty city fields, you should add another `$match` clause to explicitly handle this.
