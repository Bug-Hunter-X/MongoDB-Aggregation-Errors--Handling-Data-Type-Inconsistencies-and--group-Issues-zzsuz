# MongoDB Aggregation Errors: Handling Data Type Inconsistencies and $group Issues

This repository demonstrates some uncommon MongoDB aggregation errors related to data type issues and problems with the `$group` operator.  The errors are subtle and can be hard to debug.

The `bug.js` file shows code that produces these errors. The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to prevent these errors. 

## Error Scenarios:

* **Data Type Inconsistencies in Aggregation:**  The `$avg` operator requires numerical input. If your data has non-numeric values in the age field, the aggregation will fail.  MongoDB's error messages in such cases aren't always descriptive.
* **`$group` Operator Issues:** The `$group` operator needs a well-defined `_id` field for proper grouping.  Issues arise if the `_id` field can be null or doesn't provide unique groups.
* **`$lookup` Operator Issues:** Incorrect usage of `$lookup`'s `localField` and `foreignField` parameters, such as mismatched data types between fields, can result in unexpected results or errors.

## How to Fix:

The best approach is to validate and sanitize your data before aggregation. Preprocessing your data to ensure consistent types or using aggregation operators to handle null or missing values can prevent the most common issues. Employing stricter schema validation during data insertion and careful planning of aggregation pipelines will improve robustness.
